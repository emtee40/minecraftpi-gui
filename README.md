This program is designed to integrate with minecraft pi

Basic Instructions

 1. Open MinecraftPi (MCPI) open or create a new world 
 2. Open and run Minecraftpi-gui.py

You should at least be able to post to chat and use the other features.  
**Note that create flat world takes time.**
Flat world has been modified so it is smaller. 
This program integrates code from other sources.

Feel free to modifiy as I am sure there are some hard core Python / MCPI hackers out there who can do more with this.
